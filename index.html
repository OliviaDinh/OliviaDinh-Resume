        </h1>
        <div class="subheading mb-5">Extreme Foodie</div>
        <p class="lead mb-4">My name is Olivia Dinh and I am a second year Biology major at University of California Riverside. I am currently a pre-medicine student seeking to one day become a physician working around the Inland Empire where I can help serve the underserved community. As a college student, I am currently learning how to live on my own and how to cook food for myself. Due to this, I have become extremely interested in different kinds of foods, how they're prepared, and how they taste. My passion for food has grown immensely since coming to college to study as an undergraduate. Living away from home, I have finally realized the importance and meaning behind what it feels like to cook for someone you love, something that my parents have done for me all while I was growing up. Cooking and eating food is a love language that I wish to further my experience and skills in. <br><br>

        Coming from Irvine, California, I was fortunate enough to live around many popular food places. Irvine is known for its abundance of Asian food and culture, something that I had taken for granted when I lived there. Beyond Irvine, I have eaten in other areas in Orange County, as well as here in Inland Empire's Riverside. I do go to eat out in Los Angeles quite a few times. I would say I have gathered my experience in a wide variety of foods in Southern California. Rather than eating at home, I actually ate out a lot at several different places in high school, widening my culinary tastes. I have a wide range of food experience meaning I do not determine how good the food is based off of how expensive it is. I believe that good food is present everywhere, regardless of location and price.<br><br>

        With this in mind, there is still much I would like to spend time developing for myself. I would like to be exposed to more types of food, rather than only Southern California's food, as I believe that food changes with culture as well as location. In order to really become the expert in cooking I wish to one day be, I need to learn more about the different kinds of foods and flavors there are. I am very willing to put in as much work as necessary to complete the task and have a very determined mindset where I will not give up a task until it is perfected. I personally believe that there is no purpose in only putting half of my efforts into something I genuinely want to pursue and because of this, I tend to strive for the best, putting in all the effort I have inside. I am still new to this and am very humble, fully aware that I have much to learn if I want to one day cook all types of exquisite food that I have been lucky enough to eat in my life thus far.
